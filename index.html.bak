  I believe that some of these buses were manufactured in the USA. This is the country that saw a massive boom in industrial revolution
  and many production blueprints are now in various parts of Europe. To put it simply, transport gets more and more modernized every day.
  There are also many projects that adjust it for ecology and sustainable city development.<br><br>

  I like the fact that I balance between city life and nature. One of my friends who lives in Berlin's Moabit district says that he'd
  love to visit me in the summer when he doesn't have much study. There's a café in my area that serves Italian food and from my
  experience it's very nice.<br><br>

  As I know, they plan a special program on Christmas vacation. It should have many wondrous events and new collections for reading.
  According to their list, The Little Prince extravaganza will be there the weekend before celebrations begin. My dream is to visit
  such an event!<br><br>
